To add your profile picture:

1. Save your profile image as "profile.jpg" in this directory:
   /Users/kwu5945/dotNetResumeSite/ResumeApp/wwwroot/images/profile.jpg

2. Also copy it to the dist folder after building:
   /Users/kwu5945/dotNetResumeSite/ResumeApp/wwwroot/dist/profile.jpg

The image should be:
- Square aspect ratio (or will be cropped to circle)
- At least 300x300px for best quality
- JPG or PNG format
